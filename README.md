# Project description
Brain Games is a set of five console games based on popular mobile apps for brain exercise. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered complete. Wrong answers end the game, and it offers the player to start again. The games are:

**brain-even** - Finding if numbers are even

**brain-calc** - Calculator. Evaluate three arithmetic expressions

**brain-gcd** - Find out the greatest common divisor of two numbers

**brain-progression** - Progression. Search for missing numbers in sequences

**brain-prime** - Check if numbers are prime or not
